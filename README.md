# LwIP
 Lightweight TCP/IP stack (LwIP)  is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite that has been initially developed by Adam Dunkels and is now continued [here](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/).

 Modified to fit Arduino libraries specifications and now compiles with PlatformIO.
 Remember to put your lwipopts.h in your include/

 It is used by the [STM32Ethernet](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Ethernet) library.

## Version

This library is based on the not released version 2.2.0-dev of the LwIP stack.
Synced until upstream commit 0056522cc974d2be2005c324f37187b5b3695765
